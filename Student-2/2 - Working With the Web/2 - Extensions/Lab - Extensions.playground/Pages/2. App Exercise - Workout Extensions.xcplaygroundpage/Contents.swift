## App Exercise - Workout Extensions

 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.

 Add an extension to the `Workout` struct below and make it adopt the `CustomStringConvertible` protocol.

//:  Now create another extension for `Workout` and add a property `speed` of type `Double`. It should be a computed property that returns the average meters per second traveled during the workout.
extension Workout {

//:  Now add a method `harderWorkout` that takes no parameters and returns another `Workout` instance. This method should double the `distance` and `time` properties, and add 40 to `averageHR`. Create an instance of `Workout` and print it to the console. Then call `harderWorkout` and print the new `Workout` instance to the console.
